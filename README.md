# Hi, welcome to Peng Ju's Github page
I am currently a PhD candidate in Physics working with Prof. Tongcang Li @ Purdue Univeristy (2018.08~2024.05).

While my PhD thesis is on nanofabrication and optical levitation, I am fascinated about Machine learning and Computer vision.  

In the meanwhile, I am a Graduate Data Science Researcher at [The Data Mine, Purdue University](https://datamine.purdue.edu/). Collaborated with the [Howmet Aerospace](https://www.howmet.com/), my reserch focuses on casting (engine blade) anomaly detection from X-Ray images with computer vision and deep learning.
