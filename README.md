# Hi, welcome to Peng Ju's Github page
I am currently a PhD candidate in Physics working with Prof. Tongcang Li @ Purdue Univeristy (2018.08~2024.05). My research focus on optical levitation and nanofabrication. I use data analysis and numerical simulation, image processing to understand the physics phenomenon. I have applied Machine learning to solve challenging problems.   

In the meanwhile, I am a Graduate Data Science Researcher at [The Data Mine, Purdue University](https://datamine.purdue.edu/) (2023.01 ~ 2023.05). Collaborated with the [Howmet Aerospace](https://www.howmet.com/), my reserch focuses on casting (engine blade) anomaly detection from X-Ray images with computer vision and deep learning.

Starting from 2023-05, I am working as Graduate Research Assistant at [The Data Mine, Purdue University](https://datamine.purdue.edu/). The project is collaborated with [Eli Lilly and Company](https://www.lilly.com/).

- Built pipelines to automate meta data extraction from images/videos with Apache Airflow, Kubernetes, MinIO, Docker.
- Extracted metadata from images/videos with fine-tuned optical character recognition (OCR) models.
- Developing statistics-based data anomaly detection algorithm.
